Understanding Data Types
Test your Knowledge
1. What type would you choose for the following “numbers”?
A person’s telephone number - StringBuilder
A person’s height - float
A person’s age    - sbyte
A person’s gender (Male, Female, Prefer Not To Answer) - byte (-1 male, 1 female, 0 prefer not to answer)
A person’s salary - decimal
A book’s ISBN     - String
A book’s price    - decimal
A book’s shipping weight - uint
A country’s population - uint
The number of stars in the universe - ulong
The number of employees in each of the small or medium businesses in the
United Kingdom (up to about 50,000 employees per business) - ushort
2. What are the difference between value type and reference type variables? What is
boxing and unboxing?
- 1. Value type will directly hold the value while the reference type will hold the memory address or reference for this value.
  2.Value types are stored in stack memory and reference types are stored in heap memory.
  3.Value type will not be collected by garbage collector but reference type will be collected by the garbage collector. 
  4.The value types can be created by struct, enum while reference type can be created by class, interface, delegate or array.
  5.Value type can no accept any null values while reference types can accept null values. 
3. What is meant by the terms managed resource and unmanaged resource in .NET
- Managed resource is C# garage collector automatically handles in case of no reference to the object and garbage collected,
  but unmanaged resource does not handled by CLR, so developers need to handle it.
4. Whats the purpose of Garbage Collector in .NET?
- to free up memory space. deleting unused object automatically.

Controlling Flow and Converting Types
Test your Knowledge
1. What happens when you divide an int variable by 0? - EXCEPTION #1/1 [DivideByZeroException], Message = “Attempted to divide by zero.
2. What happens when you divide a double variable by 0? - ∞ (infinite number)
3. What happens when you overflow an int variable, that is, set it to a value beyond its range? - The operation overflows at compile time in checked mode
4. What is the difference between x = y++; and x = ++y;? 
- x = y++ is will not increment x variable because it assign first then increment y by 1, x = ++y increments y by one and assign it to the x so incremented.
5. What is the difference between break, continue, and return when used inside a loop statement?
- break will stop running loop, continue starts a new next step of loop, return will return directly terminating the loop;
6. What are the three parts of a for statement and which of them are required?
- initialization, condition, and advancement = for(initialization, condition, advancement) => for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
  condition is required it is the condition to stop loop = for(; condition;), etc => int i = 0; for(; i < 10;) {i++}
7. What is the difference between the = and == operators? - '=' assignment value but '==' is comparison that returns true/false
8. Does the following statement compile? for ( ; true; ) ; - yes
9. What does the underscore _ represent in a switch expression?
 - The underscore (_) symbol represents the default case in switch expressions, functioning similarly to the 
   default block in traditional switch statements.
10. What interface must an object implement to be enumerated over by using the foreach statement?
- IEnumerable interface permits enumeration by using a foreach loop.
